      "description": "With its 3 horns, a parrot-like beak and a large frill that could reach nearly 1 metre (3 feet) across, the Triceratops skull is one of the largest and most striking of any land animal. The horns could have been used to fend off attacks from Tyrannosaurus. A partial Triceratops fossil collected in 1997 has a horn that was bitten off, with bite marks that match Tyrannosaurus. The fossil shows that the horn healed after being bitten, so at least some Triceratops survived these encounters. Puncture marks on fossil frills show that male Triceratops also used their horns to fight each other, probably to impress females."

      "description": "This dino grew to be about 33 feet from snout to tail, and its crested skull was over five feet long. That curved, bony crest puzzled scientists in the past: Some thought it might be a super sniffer, or something like a snorkel to breathe while underwater. Turns out, the crest was a noisemaker. Scientists made the discovery by examining the tubelike holes inside the crest. One paleontologist created a replica using plastic pipes he could blow into—and out came a trumpetlike B-flat note. Scientists still aren’t sure if Parasaurolophus used its sounds for defense, attracting mates, communicating with the herd, or all of these."

      "description": "Spinosaurus was a large meat-eating dinosaur from Africa. Scientists think it may have lived a semi-aquatic lifestyle.Our understanding of Spinosaurus has changed in recent years. For over 100 years we only had very incomplete remains of this dinosaur. Plus, the few bones from the first discovery in 1912 were accidentally destroyed during the Second World War."
